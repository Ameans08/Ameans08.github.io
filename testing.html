            <h2>UCLA</h2>
            <p>I would like to attend this university because my dad went here. I would also like to attend UCLA because it has a very engineering program and the weather is always warm. Some information about this university is that the tuition price before financial aid is $37,000 and you need a GPA of at least 3.5. A big benefit is that it has good sports teams and I also want to play some sort of sport in college.</p>

    <p>When I first moved to Chicago I didn't know anything about baseball. I quickly started to watch every cubs game and start to play it more and more. Luckily for me, the year that we came was 2016, the cubs won the world series. This motivated me to play more and more baseball and now I am hoping to make baseball for Lane in the spring</p>
